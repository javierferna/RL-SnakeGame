# 🐍 RL-SnakeGame
This project features an autonomous Snake game built using the Pygame environment. The AI uses Q-learning and customized scoring functions to make optimal decisions, aiming to collect as much food as possible without colliding.

Key features:

* 🤖 Snake controlled by a reinforcement learning agent
* 🎯 Q-learning algorithm to determine the best move based on the snake's position and environment
* 📊 Dynamic scoring functions to adapt to changing circumstances
